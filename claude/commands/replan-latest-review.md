I answered questions at the end of review-plan.md
Please re-read this file and answers, rewrite the plan.
If there is a lot of changes, re-read the codebase and
latest review to ensure the plan is still relevant.
Use `gh` to check the latest review on this branch if you need to.
Lines with FIXME should be addressed in the plan.
If you have any questions please put them at the end of the plan and ask
clarification.
