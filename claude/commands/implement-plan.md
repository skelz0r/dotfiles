Implement plan defined in $1 (default: plan.md).
Please do not stop until the plan is fully implemented.
If you have strange failing tests not really related to the plan,
just ignored them and keep tracks.
If you struggle with some features tests as well, try to fix them
but do not block on them, if you consider to put wait within tests
it is not the good way, just ignore them and keep tracks.
In the end, if there is any failing tests, just put them at the end of
the plan with some explanations.
