skelz0r dotfiles
================

For unix system, with vim, git, pry and tmux.
Install some must-have plugins and aliases for developping with rails framework.

Requirements
------------

Install and set **zsh** as your login shell.

   chsh -s /bin/zsh

Recommandations
---------------

Some aliases and plugins recommand/use following programmes:

Install [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (ack-like more powerfull):

    git clone https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher

Install [hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub) (git wrapper for github):

    git clone https://github.com/defunkt/hub

Install [rvm](https://rvm.io) (Ruby Version Manager) :



Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone https://github.com/blackbirdco/dotfiles.git

Install:

    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. If you
include the line "DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE" anywhere in a config file, it
will copy that file over instead of symlinking it, and it will leave
everything above that line in your local config intact.

You can safely run `./install.sh` multiple times to update.

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations at the top of files, separated by "DO NOT EDIT BELOW
THIS LINE."

For example, the top of your `~/.gitconfig` might look like this:

    [user]
      name = Lo√Øc Delmaire
      email = loic@blackbird.co

    # DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE

    [color]
      diff = auto

The top of your `~/.zshrc` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

    # DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE

    # add the current branch name in green
    git_prompt_info() {
