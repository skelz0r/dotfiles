Check on github the latest review and make a plan to address the comments.
Use `gh` to check the latest review on this branch.
It should be exhaustive and cover all issues, one by one.
For each issue, put a "Should be addressed?" question, so that I can answer it.
If you have any questions please put them at the end of the plan and ask
clarification.
Write this plan into review-plan.md, if it does already exists, rewrite it.
