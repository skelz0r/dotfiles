# skelz0r dotfiles

For unix system, with vim, git, pry and tmux.
Install some must-have plugins and aliases for developping with rails framework.

## Requirements

Install and set **zsh** as your login shell.

```sh
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

## Recommandations

Some aliases and plugins recommand/use following programmes:

* [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (ack-like more powerfull):

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/skelz0r/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. If you
include the line "DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE" anywhere in a config file, it
will copy that file over instead of symlinking it, and it will leave
everything above that line in your local config intact.

You can safely run `./install.sh` multiple times to update.

## Make your own customizations

Put your customizations at the top of files, separated by "DO NOT EDIT BELOW
THIS LINE."

For example, the top of your `~/.gitconfig` might look like this:

```sh
[user]
name = Lo√Øc Delmaire
email = loic@blackbird.co

# DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE

[color]
diff = auto
```

The top of your `~/.zshrc` might look like this:

```
# Productivity
alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

# DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE

# add the current branch name in green
git_prompt_info() {
```


## What's in it?

  Rails file structure via `gf` and `:A` (alternate), `:Rextract` partials,
  `:Rinvert` migrations, etc.
* Run [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) specs from vim.
* Syntax highlighting for : CoffeeScript, Cucumber, Haml, Markdown, and
